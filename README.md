# Engineering Projects Data Analysis

# Objective:
The project aimed to demonstrate a comprehensive application of data analysis techniques to a dataset of engineering projects. It showcased the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex data, an essential skill in data science. The project's overarching goal was to illustrate proficiency in handling real-world data and deriving actionable intelligence from it.

# Data:
The dataset used in the project was a rich compilation of 1000 entries, each representing an engineering project with multiple attributes such as budget, resource utilization, project duration, and client satisfaction. This dataset was chosen for its complexity and relevance to real-world scenarios, offering an opportunity to apply diverse data analysis techniques.

# Methods / Tools:
A variety of data science methods and techniques were employed:
- **Data Visualization:** Techniques like histograms, KDE plots, scatter plots, and count plots were utilized to visually interpret the data, an essential aspect of exploratory data analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Descriptive statistics were used to summarize key aspects of the data, providing a foundational understanding of the dataset's characteristics.
- **Programming and Code Development:** The project involved writing and executing Python code, particularly using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, demonstrating coding skills and the ability to leverage programming for data analysis.
- **Notebook Documentation:** The use of Jupyter notebooks to document the analysis process showed an understanding of how to effectively organize and present data science workflows.
